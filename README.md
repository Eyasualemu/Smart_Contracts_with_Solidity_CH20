To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, you’ll create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses.

The following steps performed 

•	Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity
•	Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM
•	Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract



1. Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity



•	From the provided starter code, open the Solidity file
•	The following variables defined in the new contract
o	Two variables of type address payable named accountOne and accountTwo
o	A variable of type address public named lastToWithdraw
o	Two variables of type uint public named lastWithdrawAmount and contractBalance


•	Withdrawal Function Define
•	Deposit Function Define
•	Setaccount Function Define

2. Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM

•	In the Remix IDE, navigate to the “Deploy & Run Transactions” pane, and then make sure that “JavaScript VM” is selected as the environment.
•	Click the Deploy button to deploy your smart contract, and then confirm that it successfully deployed.
•	3. Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract
